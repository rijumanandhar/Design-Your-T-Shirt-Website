					<h1> How This Webite Was Made </h1>
					<p> This is a marketing website. It is a T-shirt Designing Website which   enables the user to send 	their designs, choose a shirt and get it printed. 
					The color scheme I used for this website is back white along with a hint of grey and red. </p>
					<p>There are six pages of this website. </p>
					<ol>
						<li> <A HREF="index.html"> Home </A> </li> <!--index.html-->
						<li> <A HREF="about.html"> About </A> </li> <!--about.html-->
						<li> <A HREF="shop.html"> Shop </A> </li><!--shop.html-->
						<li> <A HREF="design.html"> Design Shirts </A> </li><!--design.html-->
						<li> <A HREF="login.html"> Login/Sign Up </A> </li><!--design.html-->
						<li> <A HREF="htwwn.html"> How This Website Was Made </A> </li><!--htwwb.html-->
					</ol>
					<p> All the pages have different html files but all html files are linked to only one css file.
					Css portion contributes to its layout and overall appearance while html portion contributes to the content inside this website.
					Google Fonts are used in various parts in this Website
					</p>
					<p>
					The first page is home page.In the home page, there are five div sections
					The first div section is the #title which consists of a search button, logo and the Title of the website.
					Second div section is #menu which includes home, about, Shop, Design, How this website was made. They all have separate pages and when mouse hover over these text, they will give red neon glow.
					Third div section (#left) is on the outer left side . It consists of Log In and Sign In button which changes background and text color when mouse hovers and takes us to login/sign in page when clicked.
					Fourth div section is the #container which consists of more relevant pictures and contents for the website.
					In the home page , #container consists of <A HREF="https://www.jssor.com/demos/banner-slider.slider"> j-query banner slideshow  </A> which has 12 different banner of T-shirt.
					After the banner slide it consists of picture advertising about the website.
					Fifth div section (#right) is outside the container towards the right end. It consists of series of vertical buttons which are social media icons .The icons move towards right side on hover.
					Last div section is  #footer which contains 2 more sections inside it. The #left footer contains contact details and a link to about us while #right footer side has a copyright symbol along with the website’s name. The footer is fixed to the bottom and doesn’t move.
					</p>
					<p>All the div sections are similar to home page except for div #container of other five pages.
					The containers contains four more sections inside it. </p>
					<p>Next is About Page. Inside the div #container there are three small sections which are aligned 	
				 	vertically to the left and contain images which on hover decrease its opacity and shows text.
				 	The fourth section is wider, longer and is in right to other three sections and inside it there is an image and some paragraph about the website. </p>
					<p> After that there is Shop page. Div #container of this page contains flexbox. It is a new layout module in CSS3 made to improve the items aligns directions and order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size. There are 4 flex items in a row and four rows of flex items. The flex items hold pictures and when the mouse hovers over the picture, it shows a text which is a link to buy the shirt. Java script is used here to make sure that the user has logged in before buying any shirt and alerts a message if not.</p>
					<p> The fourth page is Design Page. This page allows the user to send their designs in order to get it printed.  The div #container of this page contains three images in a row that changes its opacity and show text when mouse hovers over it. After the images, this page has a form which allows user to select the type of shirt, color of the shirt, size, and gender. Finally it lets the user upload their design and send it using file upload button. The JavaScript used in this page which checks whether the user is logged in or not and alerts them to log in in order to submit the design. </p>
